AI Agent Management Module: This module provides a comprehensive suite of features for managing AI Agents within the AI Agent Farm, including registration, deployment, monitoring, and remote connectivity. It seamlessly handles the entire lifecycle of AI Agents and ensures efficient utilization of resources.

### 1. Registration of an AI Agent:
The module facilitates the registration process by creating a user account and setting up a password for each AI Agent on the Ubuntu operating system. This enables secure access and authentication for the AI Agents.

### 2. JupyterHub User Account Creation:
Using the JupyterHub API, the module automatically creates a dedicated JupyterHub user account for each AI Agent. It leverages the previously generated login credentials to establish a seamless integration with JupyterHub, enabling AI Agents to access Jupyter notebooks and other collaborative tools.

### 3. Remote Connectivity:
To facilitate remote connections to JupyterHub, the module interacts with the JupyterHub API to generate a unique token for each AI Agent. This token serves as a secure authentication mechanism for establishing a remote connection to JupyterHub. It allows authorized users to remotely access the AI Agent's Jupyter environment and leverage its capabilities for various tasks and experiments.

### 4. Resource Management:
The module tracks and manages the resources allocated to each AI Agent, including GPU, CPU, and RAM. During registration, the module collects information about the available resources and associates them with the corresponding AI Agent. This ensures optimal utilization and allocation of resources within the AI Agent Farm.

By combining these functionalities, the AI Agent Management Module streamlines the registration process, sets up JupyterHub user accounts, enables secure remote connections and allocates GPU, CPU, and RAM resources for AI Agents . This comprehensive approach ensures efficient management and utilization of AI Agents within the AI Agent Farm while maintaining robust security practices.


In this  code, the Ubuntu user account is created using subprocess.run() before attempting to create the JupyterHub user account. This ensures that the necessary Ubuntu credentials are in place before proceeding with the JupyterHub user account creation.

Make sure to replace the placeholder URLs (langchain-api.example.com and jupyterhub-api.example.com) with the actual API endpoints relevant to your system. Also, adjust the csv_file variable to match the path and name of your CSV file.
