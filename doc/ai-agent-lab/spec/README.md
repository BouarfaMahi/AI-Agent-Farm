## Readme

Below is a specification for defining the tasks that can be performed by the AI Agent within the AI Agent Host, which includes notebooks, QuestDB, code-server, and Grafana:

1. **Task Name**: Provide a unique name for the task.

2. **Task Description**: Provide a brief description of the task, including its purpose and objectives.

3. **Task Type**: Specify the type of task that the AI Agent will perform. This could include:

- Data Analysis: Performing exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and data visualization.
- Model Training: Training machine learning models using specific datasets and algorithms.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of trained models using predefined metrics.
-  Model Deployment: Deploying trained models for real-time predictions or integration into other systems.
- Real-time Data Processing: Processing and analyzing streaming data in real-time.
- Custom Task: Any task that doesn't fit into the predefined categories above.

4. **Task Inputs**: Specify the inputs required for the task. This could include:

- Dataset: Specify the dataset or data source required for the task.
- Parameters: Specify any specific parameters or configurations needed for the task.
- External Libraries: Specify any additional libraries or dependencies required for the task.

5.  **Task Outputs**: Specify the expected outputs or results of the task. This could include:

- Visualizations: Specify the types of visualizations or charts that should be generated.
- Trained Models: Specify the trained models that should be saved or exported.
- Performance Metrics: Specify the evaluation metrics that should be calculated.

6. **Task Execution Steps**: Provide a step-by-step description of how the task should be executed within the AI Agent Host. This could include:

- Loading and Preprocessing Data: Specify the steps for loading and preprocessing the data.
- Model Training: Specify the steps for training the machine learning models.
- Evaluation and Validation: Specify the steps for evaluating and validating the models.
- Deployment or Integration: Specify the steps for deploying or integrating the models into other systems.
- Real-time Data Processing: Specify the steps for processing and analyzing streaming data.

7. **Task Dependencies**: Specify any dependencies or prerequisites required for the task. This could include:

- Data Availability: Specify any data requirements or availability constraints.
- Model Dependencies: Specify any pre-trained models or libraries required for the task.
- Hardware or Resource Constraints: Specify any specific hardware or resource requirements.

8. **Task Monitoring**: Specify any specific monitoring or logging requirements for the task. This could include:

- Performance Metrics: Specify the metrics that should be monitored during task execution.
- Logging and Debugging: Specify the logging or debugging mechanisms to be used.
- Alerting: Specify any specific alerts or notifications that should be triggered during task execution.


By defining tasks with these specifications, you can provide clear instructions for the AI Agent within the AI Agent Host. This helps ensure that the tasks are executed correctly, allowing for better management, monitoring, and scalability of the AI Agent Farm infrastructure.

Remember to adapt the specifications based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project and the capabilities of the AI Agent Host.
