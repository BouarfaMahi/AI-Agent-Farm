This [Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-the-code-server-cloud-ide-platform-on-ubuntu-22-04)  provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the code-server  IDE platform on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine. The tutorial aims to enable users to access Microsoft Visual Studio Code remotely through their web browsers. The process involves installing code-server, configuring a systemd service to keep it running in the background, and setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy to expose the IDE platform at a custom domain secured with Let's Encrypt TLS certificates.

The prerequisites for following the tutorial include having a server running Ubuntu 22.04 with root access, at least 2GB RAM, and Nginx installed. Additionally, users need a registered domain name pointing to their server.

The tutorial starts by guiding users through the process of installing code-server on their Ubuntu 22.04 server. This involves creating a directory for code-server, downloading the latest version from GitHub, and extracting it. The tutorial then instructs users to copy the code-server source code to the appropriate directory and create a symbolic link to the code-server executable. A folder is also created to store user data.

Next, users configure a systemd service to ensure code-server runs continuously in the background. The tutorial provides the necessary service configuration file, which users create using a text editor. Users specify the service description, define its type, and provide the command to execute code-server. The configuration file also includes parameters to bind code-server to localhost, set the user data directory, and enable password authentication. Users are instructed to replace "your_password" with their desired password.

After saving and closing the service configuration file, users start the code-server service and check its status to ensure it's running correctly. To make code-server start automatically after a server reboot, users enable the service.

In the final step, users configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for code-server and expose it at their custom domain. This involves creating an Nginx server block configuration file and configuring it to proxy requests to the code-server instance. The tutorial provides the necessary Nginx configuration, including SSL settings using Let's Encrypt certificates.

Once the Nginx configuration is complete, users can access the code-server IDE platform through their custom domain, which is secured with SSL/TLS encryption.

By following this tutorial, users can set up the code-server IDE platform on their Ubuntu 22.04 server, allowing for remote access to Microsoft Visual Studio Code from a web browser.
