## Readme

This [Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04) provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and use Docker Community Edition (CE) on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. The tutorial assumes that the server has been set up by following the Ubuntu 22.04 initial server setup guide, and includes a sudo non-root user and a firewall. Additionally, it is recommended to have an account on Docker Hub if you want to create your own images and push them to Docker Hub.

In the first step, the tutorial explains how to install Docker from the official Docker repository instead of the Ubuntu repository to ensure that the latest version is installed. The process involves updating the list of packages, installing prerequisite packages that let apt use packages over HTTPS, adding the GPG key for the official Docker repository, adding the Docker repository to APT sources, updating the list of packages again, and finally installing Docker. The tutorial then checks that Docker is installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot, and shows how to confirm that Docker is running.

In the second step (optional), the tutorial explains how to execute the Docker command without sudo by adding the user to the docker group. By default, the docker command can only be run by the root user or by a user in the docker group, which is automatically created during Docker's installation process. If the user attempts to run the docker command without being in the docker group, they will receive an error message. The tutorial shows how to add the user to the docker group and how to confirm that the user has been added.

Finally, the tutorial explains how to work with containers and images, and push an image to a Docker repository. It covers topics such as running a container, accessing a container, listing containers, starting and stopping containers, removing containers, creating images, and pushing images to a Docker repository. The tutorial provides examples and commands for each topic, making it easy for users to follow along and practice.
