## Spec for setting up Prometheus with the Node Exporter

Here is a high-level spec for setting up Prometheus with the Node Exporter:

**1. Install Prometheus:**

- Download and install Prometheus on the GPU server.
- Create a new configuration file for Prometheus.

2.  Install Node Exporter:

- Install Node Exporter on each of the 10 microservers.
- Create a new configuration file for Node Exporter.

3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Node Exporter:

- In the Prometheus configuration file, add the IP addresses of the microservers where Node Exporter is installed under the "scrape_configs" section.

- Set the target to the Node Exporter endpoint on each microserver (by default, the endpoint is http://localhost:9100/metrics).
 - Add any additional configuration parameters as needed.

4. Configure alerting:

- Define alerting rules in the Prometheus configuration file.
- Configure alert notification channels (e.g., email, Slack) in the Prometheus configuration file.

5. Configure visualization:

- Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source.
- Create dashboards in Grafana to display the metrics collected by Prometheus.

6. Test the setup:

- Verify that Prometheus is scraping metrics from Node Exporter on each microserver.
- Verify that alerts are being triggered correctly.
- Verify that metrics are being displayed correctly in Grafana.

7. Monitor and maintain the setup:

- Monitor the setup for any issues (e.g., failed scrapes, alerts not triggering).

- Update the Prometheus and Node Exporter configurations as needed.

- Perform routine maintenance tasks (e.g., backups, software updates) on the Prometheus and Node Exporter installations.

Note that this is a high-level spec, and additional configuration steps may be required depending on your specific setup and requirements. It is also important to ensure that the setup is secure and follows best practices for monitoring and alerting.

### Prometheus

This installation [guide](https://devopscube.com/install-configure-prometheus-linux/) provides step-by-step instructions to manually install Prometheus on a server with administrator access, creating a monitoring system. 

the first step is to update the package repositories and download the latest Prometheus binary from the official website. 

Then, create a Prometheus user, required directories, and copy the Prometheus binary files to the appropriate location. 

The next step is to move the console and console_libraries directories and create a configuration file with the appropriate settings. 

After that, a service file needs to be created and the Prometheus service started. To access the Prometheus UI, you can use the URL with the IP address of the Prometheus server and port number 9090. 

Finally, you can register the target in the prometheus.yml file to scrape metrics and set up the Node Exporter to collect system metrics.

### Prometheus Node Expoter

This [guide](https://devopscube.com/monitor-linux-servers-prometheus-node-exporter/) explains how to install and set up Prometheus Node Exporter on a Linux server to export all node-level metrics to the Prometheus server. 

Before beginning the process, it is required to have the Prometheus server up and running and the port 9100 opened in the server firewall. 

The installation process includes downloading the latest node exporter package, unpacking it, moving the node export binary to **/usr/local/bin**, creating a custom node exporter service, and configuring the server as a target on the Prometheus server. 

The guide also provides the necessary commands to execute these steps. After installation, the node exporter would be exporting metrics on port 9100, which can be viewed by visiting the server URL on **/metrics**. 

Finally, this guide suggests querying node-related metrics using the Prometheus expression browser and visualizing node exporter metrics in Grafana.

### Integrate And Visualize Prometheus Metrics In Grafana

This [guide](https://devopscube.com/integrate-visualize-prometheus-grafana/)  explains how to visualize Prometheus metrics in Grafana, one of the best open-source visualization tools. 

It covers the installation and configuration of Grafana on both CentOS/RedHat and Ubuntu/Debian systems, adding Prometheus as a data source, creating dashboards from Prometheus metrics, and importing shared Grafana dashboards. 

The guide includes screenshots and step-by-step instructions to help users easily follow along.
