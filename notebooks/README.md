In a typical GPU server, it is common to have multiple GPUs, often ranging from 4 to 8 GPUs, depending on the server configuration. If you choose to use the Tesla K80 GPUs, which have dual GPU dies per card, you can effectively double the number of microservers without the need for an additional GPU server.

By utilizing the dual GPUs in each Tesla K80 card, you can allocate one GPU to each microserver, effectively increasing the number of microservers that can be connected to a single GPU server. This can provide more computational resources and enable parallel processing of AI tasks across the microservers.

This approach allows you to scale your AI Agent Farm infrastructure by leveraging the dual GPUs in the Tesla K80 GPUs, making it a cost-effective solution for increasing the number of microservers while utilizing the available GPU resources efficiently.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of your workload, the computational needs of your AI tasks, and the scalability goals of your infrastructure when deciding on the number and type of GPUs to use.
