### Dual GPU

In a typical GPU server, it is common to have multiple GPUs, often ranging from 4 to 8 GPUs, depending on the server configuration. If you choose to use the Tesla K80 GPUs, which have dual GPU dies per card, you can effectively double the number of microservers without the need for an additional GPU server.

By utilizing the dual GPUs in each Tesla K80 card, you can allocate one GPU to each microserver, effectively increasing the number of microservers that can be connected to a single GPU server. This can provide more computational resources and enable parallel processing of AI tasks across the microservers.

This approach allows you to scale your AI Agent Farm infrastructure by leveraging the dual GPUs in the Tesla K80 GPUs, making it a cost-effective solution for increasing the number of microservers while utilizing the available GPU resources efficiently.

It's important to consider the specific requirements of your workload, the computational needs of your AI tasks, and the scalability goals of your infrastructure when deciding on the number and type of GPUs to use.

### One GPU per microserver

If each microserver is running only one machine learning notebook, and there is no need for parallel processing or sharing GPU resources among multiple notebooks, then using a Tesla K80 GPU with dual GPU dies can still be a suitable choice.

By dedicating one GPU from the Tesla K80 to each microserver, you can effectively run a single machine learning notebook on each microserver without the need for additional GPUs. The dual GPU configuration of the Tesla K80 allows you to maximize the utilization of the GPU resources within each microserver.

Using a single GPU per microserver simplifies the resource allocation and management, as each microserver can operate independently with its dedicated GPU for running the machine learning notebook. This setup allows for easier monitoring and control of individual microservers, ensuring that each notebook has dedicated GPU resources at its disposal.

Therefore, with a Tesla K80 GPU, you can still achieve your goal of running one machine learning notebook per microserver while optimizing the utilization of available GPU resources without the need for a second GPU server.
